# wear

an unpretentious clothing tracker

## the pitch

do you ever wonder:

- what you wore yesterday or the day before, fearing a repeat or too-similar
  outfit?
- when the last time you had a (sweater|shirt|etc) dry cleaned?

worry no more. `wear` is a simple application that remembers what you wore and
when you last washed it. that's it.

## usage

run the binary on your server. it will need write access to its current
directory to persist user data.
